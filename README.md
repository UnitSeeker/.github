# .github
A org dedicated to unit testing public repositories

We are a community-driven organization dedicated to improving the quality and reliability of public repositories through systematic unit testing. Our mission is to contribute robust test coverage to open source projects that lack adequate testing infrastructure.

## What We Do

- Test Coverage Analysis: Identify public repositories with insufficient unit test coverage
- Collaborative Testing: Write comprehensive unit tests for critical open source projects
- Testing Standards: Develop and promote best practices for unit testing across different languages and frameworks
- Community Education: Share knowledge about effective testing strategies and tools

## Our Focus Areas

- Critical infrastructure projects with low test coverage
- Popular libraries and frameworks used by the community
- Educational repositories that could benefit from testing examples
- Legacy codebases in need of modernized testing approaches
